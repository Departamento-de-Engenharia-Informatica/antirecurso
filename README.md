# Antirecurso joined the server!

Hello there, and welcome the Antirecurso's github repository!

With this README.md you'll get to know everything about the project so you can contribute to it with some of your amazing code and ideas.

So, let's start, shall we? ‚ú®

## The project ü§ì

So, you might have heard of "antirecurso" before. It started out as an android mobile app that was specifically designed to help students studying for their PRCMP (Princ√≠pios de Computa√ß√£o) exams. The app was widely used by students in the first year and it passed on through "generations".

After a while, the idea to create a new and version of "antirecurso" started to be discussed around students that realized that they could do even more to help others. This project is the effort to take the app to the next level and turn it into a full-fledged platform. Now, "antirecurso" is much more than just a mobile app to study for PRCMP - it's a comprehensive study tool that can be accessed from any device with internet connection for students to study to EVERY subject.

Whether you're using a computer, a tablet, or even your phone, you can log in to "antirecurso" and access a ton of exercises to help you prepare for your exams. These exercises are presented in a form of short quizzes with 10 random questions each. After answering them, the user gets a feedback with how many they got wrong and it goes into a scoreboard.

So, if you're a student looking for a little extra help with your studies, definitely check out "antirecurso" <a href="https://antirecurso.nei-isep.org" target="_blank">here</a>. It's a game-changer when it comes to exam prep!

## The stack üîß

For this project we're using the TALL stack, and it helps with productive and agile development.

Here's a little brief of what the TALL stack is:

The TALL stack for Laravel is a set of technologies that can be used together to build web applications with the Laravel PHP framework.

Here's a brief overview of each component in the TALL stack for Laravel:

- Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a CSS framework that provides a set of utility classes for building user interfaces. It allows you to build layouts and style your application using a set of predefined classes, rather than writing your own custom CSS.

- Alpine.js: Alpine.js is a small JavaScript library that provides reactive components and two-way data binding for building user interfaces. It is often used as an alternative to larger JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js.

- Laravel Livewire: Laravel Livewire is a PHP library that makes it easy to build dynamic, interactive UIs with Laravel. It allows you to create components that can automatically update the DOM without the need for full page reloads.

- Laravel: Laravel is a popular PHP framework for building web applications. It provides a set of tools and features that make it easier to build complex, feature-rich applications. Laravel is known for its clean codebase, excellent documentation, and strong developer community.

Together, these technologies can be used to build powerful, dynamic web applications that you can use in the comfort of your house ü§ó.
